  <VCE_Celery.label>селера</VCE_Celery.label>
  <VCE_Celery.description>A vegetable consisting of a long fibrous stalk tapering into leaves. The leaves are strongly flavored and are used less often, either as a flavoring in soups and stews or as a dried herb. Celery is a staple in many soups.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Celery has a very long growth period (almost a full year!). If it can be kept alive all that time, it produces greater yield than corn.</VCE_Celery.description>

  <VCE_Pineapple.label>ананас</VCE_Pineapple.label>
  <VCE_Pineapple.description>A sweet tropical fruit with a tough leathery skin and spiky leaves on top. The word pineapple was first used to mean "pine cone," and the fruit was given this name because of its resemblance to a large pine cone.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Pineapples have a very long growth period, but they are very nutritive, taking up less space in stockpiles.</VCE_Pineapple.description>

  <VCE_Lettuce.label>салатна капуста</VCE_Lettuce.label>
  <VCE_Lettuce.description>A leaf vegetable commonly eaten fresh and served as the base of green salads. Lettuce is generally a rich source of vitamins K and A.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Lettuce can be eaten raw like strawberries, but needs to be grown in shade: outside, but under roof. It won't grow inside.</VCE_Lettuce.description>

  <VCE_BrusselsSprout.label>брюссельська капуста</VCE_BrusselsSprout.label>
  <VCE_BrusselsSprout.description>A form of cabbage grown for its edible buds called "sprouts". Brussels sprouts usually are eaten cooked, and the small young sprouts have a more delicate flavour than older ones.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Contrary to other plants, brussels sprouts thrive in snow, and receive a considerable boost to growth if snowing, AS LONG AS it is also growth season (they won't grow or be able to be planted otherwise). They won't die due to cold.</VCE_BrusselsSprout.description>

  <VCE_Cassava.label>маніока</VCE_Cassava.label>
  <VCE_Cassava.description>A tuberous edible plant also called manioc, mandioca, or yuca. They have a mild nutty taste and are commonly eaten as root vegetables in stews or as side dishes. Cassava roots are a versatile vegetable that can be used to produce flour, breads, tapioca, a laundry starch, and an alcoholic beverage.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Cassava grows best in tropical, warm and humid climates. As such, it will receive a considerable growth bonus if the weather is foggy.</VCE_Cassava.description>

  <VCE_SweetPotato.label>солодка картопля</VCE_SweetPotato.label>
  <VCE_SweetPotato.description>A plant with large, starchy, sweet-tasting (tasting similar to pumpkin), tuberous roots that are used as a root vegetable. The sweet potato is distantly related to the common potato.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Sweet potatoes show a marked preference for rocky soils, flourishing on them. Rich soils are actually detrimental to them. They do not tolerate frost, growing best at an average temperature of 24 °C, and receinving penalties under 20ºC.</VCE_SweetPotato.description>

  <VCE_Radish.label>редька</VCE_Radish.label>
  <VCE_Radish.description>An edible root vegetable that is very easy to grow and quick to harvest. Radishes are often planted by novice gardeners.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; This genetically modified radish has a very short growth period (less than 2 days). This means it is an effective crop if you need small amounts of food FAST, and the sowing and harvesting work will be the most important factor.</VCE_Radish.description>

  <VCE_Buckwheat.label>герчка</VCE_Buckwheat.label>
  <VCE_Buckwheat.description>A pseudocereal cultivated for its grain-like seeds. Its white flowers are produced in terminal clusters and after pòllination turn into triangular-shaped seeds that are enclosed by a tough dark brown or gray rind.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Buckwheat is very resistant to fire, and this variety has been modified to be completely non-flammable.</VCE_Buckwheat.description>

  <VCE_Peanut.label>арахіс</VCE_Peanut.label>
  <VCE_Peanut.description>A plant that produces seeds with an oblong shape and a papery seed coat.

Useful!</VCE_PeanutSecondary.description>

  <VCE_Sunflower.label>соняшник</VCE_Sunflower.label>
  <VCE_Sunflower.description>A large crop used for its edible oil and edible fruits. The name sunflower may derive from the flower's head's shape, which resembles the sun.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Sunflowers grow 30% faster in equatorial regions. The size of the equatorial region depends on the planet's overall temperature: below 15º for Normal, below 35º for Warm, below 65º for Hot and all the planet for Very Hot. Planets with below Normal temperature are considered to have no equator.</VCE_Sunflower.description>

  <VCE_Okra.label>бамія</VCE_Okra.label>
  <VCE_Okra.description>A flowering plant in the mallow family valued for its edible green seed pods, which are famously known for their slimy or sticky texture when cut open. Okra is a powerhouse of valuable nutrients.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Okra is very, VERY resistant to damage. Okra plants will take less damage from prolonged lack of light, and will regenerate damage caused by any other means.</VCE_Okra.description>

  <VCE_Garlic.label>часник</VCE_Garlic.label>
  <VCE_Garlic.description>A plant with long, flat grasslike leaves forming a stalk, which rises directly from the flower bulb, the part of the plant used as food and medicine. The bulb is made up of many smaller cloves covered with a papery skin.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Garlic has very little yield, but can grow in almost any terrain and takes an obscene time to rot, as dried garlic can be used to cook too.</VCE_Garlic.description>

  <VCE_Carrot.label>морква</VCE_Carrot.label>
  <VCE_Carrot.description>A herbaceous plant of the Apiaceae family that produces an edible taproot. An erect rosette of doubly compound, finely divided leaves develops above ground, while the edible carrot and attached roots are below.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Companion planting: carrots will grow faster if green beans are cultivated in the same map (up to 30% faster if 100 are found).</VCE_Carrot.description>

  <VCE_Beans.label>стручкова квастося</VCE_Beans.label>
  <VCE_Beans.description>A herbaceous bush with a long history of cultivation. They are distinguished from the many other varieties of beans in that green beans are harvested and consumed with their enclosing pods, before the bean seeds inside have fully matured, similar to peas.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Companion planting: green beans will grow faster if carrots are cultivated in the same map (up to 30% faster if 100 are found).</VCE_Beans.description>

  <VCE_Chickpea.label>нут</VCE_Chickpea.label>
  <VCE_Chickpea.description>One of the earliest cultivated legumes, widely grown for its nutritious seeds. These are high in fibre and protein and are a good source of iron, phosphorus, and folic acid.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Chickpeas grow quite fast and have good yield, but they require a LOT of space to be stored (this may be negated by stack-increasing mods, you dirty cheater, but it's up to you to decide to mess up the game's balance).</VCE_Chickpea.description>

  <VCE_BellPepper.label>болгарський перець</VCE_BellPepper.label>
  <VCE_BellPepper.description>Also known as sweet peppers, bell peppers are technically nightshades and part of the capsicum family, but they are the only chili pepper that carries a recessive gene that stops any capsaicin from being made in the fruit, thus making them not spicy.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; On average, 25% of bell peppers will mature into yellow peppers, while 75% will mature into red peppers. The former are more nutritive. If planted in large numbers this results in increased average yield.</VCE_BellPepper.description>

  <VCE_YellowBellPepper.label>болгарський перець</VCE_YellowBellPepper.label>
  <VCE_YellowBellPepper.description>Also known as sweet peppers, bell peppers are technically nightshades and part of the capsicum family, but they are the only chili pepper that carries a recessive gene that stops any capsaicin from being made in the fruit, thus making them not spicy.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; On average, 25% of bell peppers will mature into yellow peppers, while 75% will mature into red peppers.

  <VCE_Taro.label>таро</VCE_Taro.label>
  <VCE_Taro.description>A tropical plant grown primarily for its edible corm, a root vegetable. Taro is one of the few crops that can be grown under flooded conditions, with the base of the plant always under water. This is due to air spaces in the petiole, which permit underwater gaseous exchange with the atmosphere.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Taro is only growable in aquatic growing zones, which ignore fertility. These plants will however take a long time to sow and harvest, basically exchanging colonist work for growing plants in a normally unused space. Taro is the baseline aquatic plant.</VCE_Taro.description>

  <VCE_Watercress.label>настурція</VCE_Watercress.label>
  <VCE_Watercress.description>Watercress is a rapidly growing, perennial plant. It is one of the oldest known leaf vegetables consumed by humans. Watercress and many of its relatives are noteworthy for their piquant flavors.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Watercress is only growable in aquatic growing zones, which ignore fertility. These plants will however take a long time to sow and harvest, basically exchanging colonist work for growing plants in a normally unused space. Watercress grows faster than taro but needs a lot of space, blocking sowing in adjacent spaces.</VCE_Watercress.description>

  <VCE_Lotus.label>лотус</VCE_Lotus.label>
  <VCE_Lotus.description>Sometimes colloquially called a water lily, lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas.
