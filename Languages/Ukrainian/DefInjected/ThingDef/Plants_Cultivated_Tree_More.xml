  <VCE_TreeAvocado.label>авокадо</VCE_TreeAvocado.label>
  <VCE_TreeAvocado.description>An evergreen tree with thick, leathery leaves that produces perfect white, ivory to yellow flowers. The fruit has a large seed or pit in the center and may be green or nearly black.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Avocado trees take a notoriously long period to mature and produce their fruits. If they can be kept alive all that time, they produce greater yield than other fruit trees. Plus if you install the Coffees and Teas mod and pair them with Pumpkin Spice Coffee you can have your dream RimWorld Hipster experience!</VCE_TreeAvocado.description>

  <VCE_TreeOlive.label>маслини</VCE_TreeOlive.label>
  <VCE_TreeOlive.description>A subtropical broad-leaved evergreen tree. Its leaves, leathery and lance-shaped, are dark green above and silvery on the underside and are paired opposite each other on the twig. The wood is resistant to decay. If the top dies back, a new trunk will often arise from the roots.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Interestingly, olive trees show a marked preference for rocky soils, flourishing on them. Rich soils are actually detrimental to them. They will also live for a very, very long time, far longer than other produce trees. Contrary to other tree produce, olives can't be eaten raw.</VCE_TreeOlive.description>

  <VCE_CoconutPalm.label>огірок</VCE_CoconutPalm.label>
  <VCE_CoconutPalm.description>A palm tree cultivated extensively in tropical areas for its edible fruit, the coconut. Coconut palms flourish best close to the sea on low-lying areas a few feet above high water.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All fruit trees take about four times as much space as regular crops, take a long time to grow and produce fruits that can be eaten raw. They aren't destroyed after harvesting but have a limited lifespan and will eventually need to be replanted.\n\nCoconut palms are only growable in sandy growing zones, which ignore fertility. These plants will however take a long time to sow and harvest, basically exchanging colonist work for growing plants in a normally unused space.\n\nCoconut palms receive a growth bonus if sea water tiles are found in a 6 tile radius. Coconuts can be used as fruits or processed into milk.</VCE_CoconutPalm.description>

  <VCE_TreeAlmond.label>мигдаль</VCE_TreeAlmond.label>
  <VCE_TreeAlmond.description>A deciduous tree cultivated for its fruit, almonds. The sweet almond can be eaten plain or be used as ingredient in desserts and confectioneries. The trees are strikingly beautiful when in flower; they produce fragrant, five-petaled, light pink to white flowers.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All fruit trees take about four times as much space as regular crops, take a long time to grow and produce fruits that can be eaten raw. They aren't destroyed after harvesting but have a limited lifespan and will eventually need to be replanted.\n\nAlmond trees are beautiful, but they require water to be present in a 6 tile radius to grow properly. Almonds can be used as fruits or processed into milk.</VCE_TreeAlmond.description>

  <VCE_TreeMango.label>манго</VCE_TreeMango.label>
  <VCE_TreeMango.description>A tropical evergreen tree that produces oval fruits, vividly coloured with shades of red and yellow. The single large seed is flattened, and the flesh that surrounds it is yellow to orange in colour, juicy, and of distinctive sweet-spicy flavour.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All fruit trees take about four times as much space as regular crops, take a long time to grow and produce fruits that can be eaten raw. They aren't destroyed after harvesting but have a limited lifespan and will eventually need to be replanted.\n\nMango trees have very good yield, but mangoes cannot be frozen or they get destroyed. The game won't be smart enough to detect this, so disable them from freezers.</VCE_TreeMango.description>
